# Applied GovTech AI Infrastructure for Municipalities

## Founder Pitch Deck (EWOR Application)

---

## 1. One-Liner

**Applied AI infrastructure that becomes the primary interface between citizens and public institutions, built on verified public-sector data.**

---

## 2. Problem

Public-sector communication is inefficient, fragmented, and heavily manual.

Citizens repeatedly ask the same questions across multiple channels, while municipal employees spend a significant portion of their time answering basic informational requests instead of focusing on higher-value work.

The problem is not a lack of information, but the lack of a reliable, scalable interface that citizens can naturally rely on when interacting with public institutions.

---

## 3. Solution

An applied GovTech AI platform that automates the first layer of interaction between citizens and municipalities.

The system uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) over verified public-sector documents to deliver accurate, real-time responses while providing administrations with operational insight into recurring issues, information gaps, and structural inefficiencies.

Over time, the system becomes the default entry point for citizen interaction — a core layer of public-sector communication.

---

## 4. Why This Is Applied AI (Not a Chatbot)

- AI is the core functionality, not a feature
- Accuracy, traceability, and trust are prioritized over creativity
- Responses are grounded in verified public documents
- Human-in-the-loop workflows handle sensitive and edge cases
- The system improves institutional efficiency, not just user experience

This is applied AI built for high-trust, real-world environments.

## 5. Core Applied AI & GovTech Challenges

Building applied AI in public institutions introduces non-trivial challenges:

### 5.1 Fragmented and Unstructured Data
Municipal information exists in inconsistent formats and locations. The system must normalize, contextualize, and retrieve information reliably.

### 5.2 Accuracy Over Creativity
Incorrect answers create legal and reputational risk. The system is designed to avoid hallucinations and prioritize correctness.

### 5.3 Public vs. Sensitive Information
Documents vary in access level. The AI must respect boundaries, provide partial answers when required, and escalate to humans when appropriate.

### 5.4 Knowledge Lifecycle Management
Public information changes constantly. The system tracks validity, versioning, and relevance over time.

### 5.5 Multi-City Scaling Without Custom Builds
Each municipality differs in structure and terminology. The platform scales across cities without custom implementations while maintaining data isolation.

### 5.6 From Support Tool to Core Infrastructure
Beyond answering questions, the system surfaces recurring problems and structural inefficiencies, positioning AI as a decision-support and infrastructure layer.

This is an AI system design and governance problem, not prompt engineering.

## 6. Founder–Problem Fit

I have personally experienced public-sector inefficiencies through paperwork, unclear processes, and repeated time loss.

Living in different cities and working with municipalities made it clear this is a systemic issue rather than a local one.

As a solo founder, I am building the system hands-on and understand both the technical and institutional constraints of applying AI in public-sector environments.

---

## 7. Market Context & Opportunity

In Croatia and the broader regional market, there is currently no standardized AI infrastructure for citizen–government communication.

Most municipalities rely on fragmented legacy systems or manual processes. This creates a significant first-mover opportunity to establish a default GovTech AI layer with high switching costs once adopted.

The regional public-sector market represents a greenfield opportunity for a scalable, infrastructure-first applied AI platform.

---

## 8. Current Status

- Live demo in active development (online soon)
- Ongoing conversations with multiple municipalities
- Early validation that the problem is widespread and operationally costly
- Strong interest in reducing manual workload and improving citizen experience

---

## 9. Business Model

The platform is offered as a SaaS subscription to municipalities.

- Annual licensing
- Pricing based on population size and document complexity
- Typical public-sector sales cycle of 12–24 months
- Focus on long-term partnerships and system integration

---

## 10. Long-Term Vision (5–10 Years)

To become core civic AI infrastructure for public-sector communication.

Starting with municipalities, the platform can expand horizontally to regional and national institutions, becoming a standard interface between citizens and government systems.

This is an infrastructure company, not a feature-driven SaaS product.

---

## 11. Why EWOR

EWOR is a strong fit because this company is being built for the long term in a complex, regulated market.

Key areas where EWOR support is critical:
- Pricing and procurement strategy in public-sector SaaS
- Fundraising for infrastructure-first applied AI companies
- Strategic mentorship and accountability during early scaling

EWOR’s focus on founder development aligns with how I want to build this company.

---

## 12. Commitment

This is a long-term mission.

I am fully committed to building this company over the next 5–10 years and reshaping public-sector communication through applied GovTech AI.
